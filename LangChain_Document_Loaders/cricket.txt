Beneath the sun, the field aglow,
Eleven shadows shift and throw.
A leather ball arcs through the air,
The bat responds with sudden flair.

The crowd erupts, a thunderous cheer,
Moments of glory echo near.
Patience lingers, calm and deep,
As bowlers plot, their secrets keep.

Each boundary tells a fleeting song,
Each wicket falls, the game moves on.
In overs spent, in silence tight,
The heart of cricket burns so bright.

Not just a sport, but time’s own art,
Binding rivals, worlds apart.
With every pitch, with every strike,
It lives in souls who hold it like
A story written, bold, complete,
In dust, in grass, beneath our feet.
